I work on improving our understanding of the ecology and evolution of tropical ecosystems, specifically savannas. I do this via linking remotely sensed data, experimental data, meta-analyses and field observations. My current field research program focuses on understudied regions such as Madagascar, southern Africa and South-East Asia and how improved understanding of these regions can inform understanding of community assembly and dynamics of grassy biomes.

I work on understanding the dynamics of savanna ecosystems in the context of global change. My work integrates field ecological data, remote sensing, modelling, and biogeochemistry. I am involved in collaborative research projects with Yale University, Edinburgh University and the University of Liverpool among others which variously work on fire-grazer interactions, inter-continental savanna comparisons, the importance of land-atmosphere feedbacks, and pursuing a global theory of fire.

#### Bat Vorontsova
_Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, United Kingdom_

I study grasses and everything about them, with a particular focus on tropical African diversity and poorly known lineages, their evolutionary history, and the history of tropical grasslands and savannas. I use herbarium based alpha taxonomy to enrich our understanding of ecosystems and their function. My main research direction is a full taxonomic treatment of Poaceae for the Flora of Madagascar, a long term project incorporating a range of ecological, phylogenetic, ethnobotanical, and horticultural work.

My research interests lie in understanding how large mammal herbivores shape vegetation communities in African ecosystems - both at very large scales and via interactive effects with fire. I am currently analysing patterns of historical herbivore biomass and fire at the continental scale in Africa. My field research explores grass community responses to frequent grazing.

#### Anya Courtenay
_The University of Edinburgh, Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, United Kingdom_

I am a database and website manager for GGG. I am interested in the intersection of ecology, biogeography and data science with the aim to understand the biodiversity change in the grassy biomes. My current research focuses on the effects of woody encroachment and fire suppression on ground layer diversity.
