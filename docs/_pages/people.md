#### Saly Archibald
_Professor at University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa_

I work on understanding the dynamics of savanna ecosystems in the context of global change. My work integrates field ecological data, remote sensing, modelling, and biogeochemistry. I am involved in collaborative research projects with Yale University, Edinburgh University and the University of Liverpool among others which variously work on fire-grazer interactions, inter-continental savanna comparisons, the importance of land-atmosphere feedbacks, and pursuing a global theory of fire.

My research interests lie in understanding how large mammal herbivores shape vegetation communities in African ecosystems - both at very large scales and via interactive effects with fire. I am currently analysing patterns of historical herbivore biomass and fire at the continental scale in Africa. My field research explores grass community responses to frequent grazing.
