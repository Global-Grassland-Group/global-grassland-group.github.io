#### Sampling protocols
<br>
Our **community composition** protocol, fieldsheets and data entry forms can be found on [Protocol Exchange](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.pex-1905/v1). Please contact <a href="mailto:jakub.wieczorkowski@ed.ac.uk">Jakub.Wieczorkowski@ed.ac.uk</a> to receive a protocol in a different format.

If you are interested in sampling **functional traits**, you can access <a href="https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/pdf/BT20048">'A handbook for the standardised sampling of plant functional traits in disturbance-prone ecosystems, with a focus on open ecosystems'</a> by Wigley et al. (2020).
