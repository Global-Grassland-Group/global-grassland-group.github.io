## Roots, Rain, and Resilience: Sampling shenanigans in the grasslands of South Africa
###### *November 2023*
###### *By Eulalia Jordaan and Elaine Slooten*

In January 2023 two budding researchers Elaine Slooten and Eulalia Jordaan, from the North West University (NWU) in South Africa embarked on a two-month sampling journey to gather soil and floristic data. This expedition was part of the Future Ecosystems for Africa (FEFA) program for their MSc’s, supported by Oppenheimer Generations Research and Conservation, Frances Siebert (NWU), and Sally Archibald (University of Witwatersrand).

The aim of this research is to determine to which degree the floristic and functional diversity, as well as the carbon stocks (including soil – and plant organic carbon), of Highveld grasslands in South Africa can recover after being ploughed. It highlights the risks of ploughing South Africa’s grassland ecosystems and informs landowners and land-use planners about these risks. Our published [paper](https://sajs.co.za/article/view/15540) in the [South African Journal of Science](https://sajs.co.za/index) summarises international studies, illustrating that biodiverse ‘old-growth grasslands’ can lose up to 50% of their soil carbon during ploughing.
