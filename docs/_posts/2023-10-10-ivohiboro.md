Madagascar's flora is exceptionally diverse and largely endemic, with ecosystems ranging from vast grasslands to tropical forests and deserts. [Kew](https://www.kew.org/science/collections-and-resources/research-facilities/kew-madagascar-conservation-centre) has been working in Madagascar since 1986, collaborating with Malagasy and international researchers. 

In May 2016, a team of biologists from the [ValBio Centre](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/centre-valbio/science/ivohiboro.php#:~:text=The%20Ivohiboro%20Protected%20Area%20is,of%20representatives%20from%20surrounding%20villages.) encountered a large piece of almost intact forest, home to threatened species of lemurs and chameleons, on Mount Vohibory in the southeast of Ihosy. This forest is now part of the Ivohiboro Protected Area, established in 2023 and covering approximately 3,700 hectares. It is managed by the Malagasy Institut pour la Conservation des Ecosystèmes (MICET) with the ValBio Centre, the Ministry of Environment and ustainable Development of Madagascar, and local representatives. Many activities have been conducted by partners in Ivohiboro, such as the [Phoenix Conservancy](https://www.phoenixconservancy.org/madagascar) who have constructed firebreaks around Ivohiboro and initiated restoration efforts while improving local livelihoods.

In October 2023, ValBio invited botanists from Kew, MBG and the national herbarium (PBZT) for the second biological inventory of the site. A team of about 50 people participated, with Kew Madagascar’s grass team conducting fieldwork led by Fenitra Randrianarimanana.

We did a standardised inventory using the [Global Grassy Group plot method](https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/article/pex-1905/v1) and mapping to quantify species richness and composition of herbaceous plants in grassy biomes.

We surveyed grassland and forest areas in Analabe, the north part of the Protected Area, to look for localities with the greatest Poaceae diversity such as the high elevation grassy ecosystem above the forest. We have also done some plots in the savannas near the Phoenix Conservancy experimental reforestation.

Among the grass formations where we sampled, there is a mix of savanna compositions in the north part: including *Loudetia simplex*, *Andropogon* spp., *Hyparrhenia* spp., and *Heteropogon contortus* savannas. 

The main dominant Poaceae is *Loudetia simplex*, known locally as "Horo", which according to local people is the basis of the region's name "Ihorombe".

Our plant inventories should help to identify the savannas' value for their biodiversity and environmental potential, including selecting good grazing areas for the people surrounding the Protected Area and identifying appropriate areas for tree planting. This area is now a part of the study site of the TANETI project, funded by [GCBC](https://www.gcbc.org.uk/) to optimize spatial resource management of Madagascar's open grassy ecosystems supporting livelihoods, climate, and biodiversity in a global biodiversity hotspot. Although Ivohiboro is among the red areas of the Ihorombe region for insecurity, we find that it is a potential site for grass collection both in the savannas and inside the forest.

These results are just the beginning. It is important to note that our work to date represents a partial inventory only and further visits to the site for botanical surveying during different seasons would be required to provide a more complete plant lists.
