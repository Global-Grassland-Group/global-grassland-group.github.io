Madagascar's flora is exceptionally diverse and largely endemic, with ecosystems ranging from vast grasslands to tropical forests and deserts. (Kew)[https://www.kew.org/science/collections-and-resources/research-facilities/kew-madagascar-conservation-centre] has been working in Madagascar since 1986, collaborating with Malagasy and international researchers. 

In May 2016, a team of biologists from the ValBio Centre discovered a large piece of almost intact forest on Mount Vohibory in the southeast of Ihosy. This forest is now part of the New Protected Area (NPA) of Ivohiboro, established in 2023 and covering approximately 3,700 hectares. It is managed by the Malagasy Institut pour la Conservation des Ecosystèmes (MICET) in collaboration with the Centre ValBio, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of Madagascar, and a committee of representatives from surrounding villages.

Since its discovery, many activities have been conducted in this NPA. In 2019, the Phoenix Conservancy began constructing firebreaks around Ivohiboro and initiated restoration efforts while improving local livelihoods. 
In October 2023, ValBio invited botanists from Kew, MBG and the PBZT national herbarium for the second biological inventory of the site. A team of about 50 people participated, with Kew Madagascar’s grass team conducting fieldwork led by Fenitra Randrianarimanana.

We surveyed grassland and forest areas in Analabe, the north part of the NPA, to look for localities with the greatest Poaceae diversity, such as the high elevation grassy ecosystem above the forest.

We did a standardised inventory using the Global Grassy Group plot method and mapping to quantify species richness and composition of herbaceous plants in grassy biomes.

Among the grass formations where we sampled, there is a mix of savanna compositions in the north part: including Loudetia simplex, Andropogon spp., Hyparrhenia spp., and Heteropogon contortus savannas. We have also done some plots in the savannas near the Phoenix Conservation experimental reforestation.

The main dominant Poaceae is Loudetia simplex, known locally as "Horo", which according to local people is the basis of the region's name "Ihorombe".

These plant inventories should help to identify the savanna's value for their biodiversity and environmental potential, including selecting good grazing areas for the people surrounding the NPA and identifying appropriate areas for tree planting. This area is now a part of the study site of the TANETI project, funded by GCBC to optimize spatial resource management of Madagascar's open grassy ecosystems supporting livelihoods, climate, and biodiversity in a global biodiversity hotspot. Although Ivohiboro NPA is among the red areas of the Ihorombe region for insecurity, we find that it is a potential site for grass collection both in the savannas and inside the forest.

These results are just the beginning. It is important to note that our work to date represents a partial inventory only and further visits to the site for botanical surveying during different seasons would be required to provide a more complete plant list for the site.
