Madagascar's flora is exceptionally diverse and largely endemic, with ecosystems ranging from vast grasslands to tropical forests and deserts. Kew has been working in Madagascar since 1986, collaborating with Malagasy and international researchers. 

In May 2016, a team of biologists from the ValBio Centre discovered a large piece of almost intact forest on Mount Vohibory in the southeast of Ihosy. This forest is now part of the New Protected Area (NPA) of Ivohiboro, established in 2023 and covering approximately 3,700 hectares. It is managed by the Malagasy Institut pour la Conservation des Ecosyst√®mes (MICET) in collaboration with the Centre ValBio, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of Madagascar, and a committee of representatives from surrounding villages.
