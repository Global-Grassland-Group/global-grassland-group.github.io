The landscape of Bicuar National Park in southwest Angola is characterised by networks of shallow valleys called catenas. Up on the crest, locally known as ‘tundas’, are miombo woodlands with open canopies and a continuous grassy understorey. In some cases, closed-canopy thickets with dense understories occur. Downslope, you find suffrutex grasslands dominated by geoxyles or ‘underground trees’, which are plants with extensive woody underground storage organs. In the valley bottoms there are seasonally waterlogged grasslands called ‘mulolas’. Work by Teixeira (see [Huntly](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-03083-4), 2019) initially categorised these different vegetation groups.

Across Bicuar, the [SEOSAW](https://seosaw.github.io/) network has set up permanent plots to monitor dynamics in the miombo overstory such as growth and mortality rates of trees and smaller woody stems. In February 2024, we were invited to join a collaborative field expedition and sample different components of the understory vegetation and environment. Our team, from Instituto Superior Politécnico Tundavala (Angola), the University of the Witwatersrand (South Africa), and the University of Edinburgh (UK), focussed on two outcomes:

- To sample the herbaceous vegetation on the same plots using the Global Grassy Group [protocol](https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/article/pex-1905/v1) to demonstrate ground-layer diversity and how this may differ in response to environmental dynamics in different parts of the catena landscape. 

- To establish microclimate transects across the catena down a gradient of vegetation types to calibrate microclimate models, with the aim to predict seasonal frost occurrence as a response to vegetation and tree cover.

As we traversed transects and collected our ground-layer and microclimate data, we noticed that some sites across the catena had very stark boundaries in vegetation and others had wider transition zones. It made us ask how and why it is useful to divide these vegetation types into neatly defined boxes and at what scales these distinctions make sense. In this blog, we would like to share field observations and reflect on the nature of each vegetation type, by inviting you to come sampling with us down the catena slope.

**Thicket**

Starting up on the catena crests in thickets, we weaved ourselves and our tape measures under and over thorny trees and tangled lianas. The visibility was poor in the dense vegetation and we had to use our voices and GPS devices to navigate through the thicket to set up our plots and collect data. Although the shade provided welcome relief, we must admit that some of us were reminded why we love working in open, expansive grassy ecosystems! Collecting data here was time- and energy-intensive, but it was valuable to become well acquainted with an ‘alternative’ vegetation state that occurs in the absence of many disturbances.
