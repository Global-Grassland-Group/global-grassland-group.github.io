## Workshop and herbaceous sampling in Mpumalanga - December 2022

The Global Grassy Group (GGG) gathers ecologists and biologists with aim to standardise and improve vegetation sampling in savannas and grasslands. As the herbaceous layer came into flower, we held a GGG workshop to brainstorm our future research and sample species composition at the Telperion Nature Reserve in Mpumalanga, South Africa. 

Telperionâ€™s land-use history has included a period of cultivation. Previous land owners ploughed and planted crops including maize, potato and watermelon in some areas of the reserve. Ploughing last occurred roughly 50 years ago and, since then, the reserve has been managed with the intention of allowing native vegetation to recover through natural succession. The composition of vegetation varies across Telperion as a result of both environmental factors and past human activity ().
