## Workshop and herbaceous sampling in South Africa - December 2022

As the herbaceous layer came into flower, we held a GGG workshop to brainstorm our future research and sample species composition at the Telperion Nature Reserve in Mpumalanga, South Africa. 

Telperion’s land-use history has included a period of cultivation. Previous land owners cultivated crops including maize and potato in some areas of the reserve. Ploughing last occurred roughly 50 years ago and, since then, the reserve has been managed with the intention of allowing native vegetation to recover through natural succession. The composition of vegetation varies across Telperion as a result of both environmental factors and past human activity (Brown et al., 2022).

The GGG team, colleagues and students undertook fieldwork using the GGG sampling protocol to compare species composition at two sites at Telperion. The first was a never-ploughed site and the second was a previously-ploughed site where vegetation has reassembled over the last 50 years. We asked, ‘has ploughing impacted the species richness and composition of grasses and herbaceous plants’?

While we found a species richness of 56 different plants across our plots at the never-ploughed site, just 27 were recorded at the previously-ploughed site. There were also obvious differences in the species composition and functional groups present at each site. A good example is the indigenous dwarf shrub Seriphium plumosum (‘bankrupt bush‘) that encroaches and displaces grasses following cultivation, thereby reducing grazing capacity, decreasing biodiversity (Brown et al., 2022). Seriphium plumosum was absent at the never-ploughed site but covered large areas in the previously-ploughed site. The impact of ploughing has therefore halved the diversity and meant that vegetation has not reassembled to the expected composition in that area.

Such comparisons between land-use or along environmental gradients (including climate, soil, fire and herbivory) are made possible through the standardisation of data collection methodologies offered by GGG. The interdisciplinary approach offers an opportunity to reconcile the gap between botanical collecting and ecological sampling, which remains a scientific challenge (Baker et al., 2017).
